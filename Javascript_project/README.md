# Overview

Here, I am trying to create a Site that allows the user to be able to play a matching game.

The game will start with a bunch of "cards" facedown, and the user will click on one of these cards to reveal it. The card will stay revealed until the user selects another card, in which case the cards will remain as they are for 1 second, and then both will flip down. Should the user get a match with the cards, both selected cards will dissapear. This game will continue until there are no cards left, in which case the site will prompt the user if they wish to play again.

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the JavaScript language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

I am writing this software because I think that it is valuable for me to learn a new language. I also think that this wil complement my ability to write in HTML and CSS. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

- Need to create areas in HTML that will help present what I want to the user
- Need to add a Javascript Function that will cause the cards to turn around when the user clicks (OnClick)
- Need to allow the user to reset the board. This prompt should happen when the game is finished, but a button that allows the game to be reset is acceptable.
